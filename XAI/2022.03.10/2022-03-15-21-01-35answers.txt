deal with eu staff issues , and then a separate court of auditor ##s . under the treaty on european union article 19 ( 2 ) there is one judge from each member state , 28 at present , who are supposed to \" possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices \" ( or for the general court , the \" ability required for appointment to high judicial office \" ) . a president is elected by the judges for three years . under te ##u article 19 ( 3 ) is to be the ultimate court to interpret questions of eu law . in fact , most eu law is applied by member state courts ( the english court of appeal , the german bun ##des ##ger ##ich ##ts ##hof , the belgian co ##ur du tr ##ava ##il , etc . ) but they can refer questions to the eu court for a preliminary ruling . the c ##je ##u ' s duty is to \" ensure that in the interpretation and application of the treaties the law is observed \" , although realistic ##ally it has the ability to expand and develop
