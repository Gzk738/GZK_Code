# Fine-tuning a model on a question-answering task

In this notebook, we will see how to fine-tune one of the [ðŸ¤— Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) model to a question answering task, which is the task of extracting the answer to a question from a given context. We will see how to easily load a dataset for these kinds of tasks and use the `Trainer` API to fine-tune a model on it.

![Widget inference representing the QA task](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/master/examples/images/question_answering.png?raw=1)

**Note:** This notebook finetunes models that answer question by taking a substring of a context, not by generating new text.

This notebook is built to run on any question answering task with the same format as SQUAD (version 1 or 2), with any model checkpoint from the [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) as long as that model has a version with a token classification head and a fast tokenizer (check on [this table](https://huggingface.co/transformers/index.html#bigtable) if this is the case). It might just need some small adjustments if you decide to use a different dataset than the one used here. Depending on you model and the GPU you are using, you might need to adjust the batch size to avoid out-of-memory errors. Set those three parameters, then the rest of the notebook should run smoothly:
"""

# This flag is the difference between SQUAD v1 or 2 (if you're using another dataset, it indicates if impossible
# answers are allowed or not).

"""## Loading the dataset

We will use the [ðŸ¤— Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) library to download the data and get the metric we need to use for evaluation (to compare our model to the benchmark). This can be easily done with the functions `load_dataset` and `load_metric`.

"""## Preprocessing the training data

Before we can feed those texts to our model, we need to preprocess them. This is done by a ðŸ¤— Transformers `Tokenizer` which will (as the name indicates) tokenize the inputs (including converting the tokens to their corresponding IDs in the pretrained vocabulary) and put it in a format the model expects, as well as generate the other inputs that model requires.

To do all of this, we instantiate our tokenizer with the `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained` method, which will ensure:

- we get a tokenizer that corresponds to the model architecture we want to use,
- we download the vocabulary used when pretraining this specific checkpoint.

That vocabulary will be cached, so it's not downloaded again the next time we run the cell.

They don't matter much for what we're doing here (just know they are required by the model we will instantiate later), you can learn more about them in [this tutorial](https://huggingface.co/transformers/preprocessing.html) if you're interested.

Now one specific thing for the preprocessing in question answering is how to deal with very long documents. We usually truncate them in other tasks, when they are longer than the model maximum sentence length, but here, removing part of the the context might result in losing the answer we are looking for. To deal with this, we will allow one (long) example in our dataset to give several input features, each of length shorter than the maximum length of the model (or the one we set as a hyper-parameter). Also, just in case the answer lies at the point we split a long context, we allow some overlap between the features we generate controlled by the hyper-parameter `doc_stride`:

The ðŸ¤— Datasets library is normally smart enough to detect when the function you pass to map has changed (and thus requires to not use the cache data). For instance, it will properly detect if you change the task in the first cell and rerun the notebook. ðŸ¤— Datasets warns you when it uses cached files, you can pass `load_from_cache_file=False` in the call to `map` to not use the cached files and force the preprocessing to be applied again.

Note that we passed `batched=True` to encode the texts by batches together. This is to leverage the full benefit of the fast tokenizer we loaded earlier, which will use multi-threading to treat the texts in a batch concurrently.

## Fine-tuning the model

Now that our data is ready for training, we can download the pretrained model and fine-tune it. Since our task is question answering, we use the `AutoModelForQuestionAnswering` class. Like with the tokenizer, the `from_pretrained` method will download and cache the model for us:
"""

from transformers import AutoModelForQuestionAnswering, TrainingArguments, Trainer

model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(model_checkpoint)

"""The warning is telling us we are throwing away some weights (the `vocab_transform` and `vocab_layer_norm` layers) and randomly initializing some other (the `pre_classifier` and `classifier` layers). This is absolutely normal in this case, because we are removing the head used to pretrain the model on a masked language modeling objective and replacing it with a new head for which we don't have pretrained weights, so the library warns us we should fine-tune this model before using it for inference, which is exactly what we are going to do.

To instantiate a `Trainer`, we will need to define three more things. The most important is the [`TrainingArguments`](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.TrainingArguments), which is a class that contains all the attributes to customize the training. It requires one folder name, which will be used to save the checkpoints of the model, and all other arguments are optional:
"""

model_name = model_checkpoint.split("/")[-1]
args = TrainingArguments(
    f"{model_name}-finetuned-squad",
    evaluation_strategy = "epoch",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=batch_size,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=batch_size,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    push_to_hub=True,
)

"""Here we set the evaluation to be done at the end of each epoch, tweak the learning rate, use the `batch_size` defined at the top of the notebook and customize the number of epochs for training, as well as the weight decay.

The last argument to setup everything so we can push the model to the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) regularly during training. Remove it if you didn't follow the installation steps at the top of the notebook. If you want to save your model locally in a name that is different than the name of the repository it will be pushed, or if you want to push your model under an organization and not your name space, use the `hub_model_id` argument to set the repo name (it needs to be the full name, including your namespace: for instance `"sgugger/bert-finetuned-squad"` or `"huggingface/bert-finetuned-squad"`).

Then we will need a data collator that will batch our processed examples together, here the default one will work:
"""

Evaluating our model will require a bit more work, as we will need to map the predictions of our model back to parts of the context.

"""We have one logit for each feature and each token. The most obvious thing to predict an answer for each featyre is to take the index for the maximum of the start logits as a start position and the index of the maximum of the end logits as an end position."""

However, picking the second best answer is not as easy as picking the best one: is it the second best index in the start logits with the best index in the end logits? Or the best index in the start logits with the second best index in the end logits? And if that second best answer is not possible either, it gets even trickier for the third best answer.


To classify our answers, we will use the score obtained by adding the start and end logits. We won't try to order all the possible answers and limit ourselves to with a hyper-parameter we call `n_best_size`. We'll pick the best indices in the start and end logits and gather all the answers this predicts. After checking if each one is valid, we will sort them by their score and keep the best one.

- the ID of the example that generated the feature (since each example can generate several features, as seen before);

When one example gives several features, we have to predict the impossible answer when all the features give a high score to the impossible answer (since one feature could predict the impossible answer just because the answer isn't in the part of the context it has access too), which is why the score of the impossible answer for one example is the *minimum* of the scores for the impossible answer in each feature generated by the example.
